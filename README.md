# PabloNerudaBot

Twitter Bot infrastructure that scrapes GoodReads for quotes by Pablo Neruda, normalizes their formatting, and pushes them into a local mongo database. Another script is being developed to tweet them out as parsed tweets. 

Test phase is basically complete, next steps are:

1) Create testing environment around the execution of the scripts
2) Set up my raspberry pi again
3) Deploy in a constantly running support structure
4)
